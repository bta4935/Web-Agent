Okay, that makes sense!

Seeing `"Simple browser launch test successful!"` is actually **good news**! It confirms a few important things:

1.  Your `wrangler.toml` **is correctly configured** with the `[browser]` binding (`binding = "BROWSER"`).
2.  The Cloudflare Browser Rendering API **is accessible** from your account with your token.
3.  The core `@cloudflare/puppeteer` library **can successfully launch** a browser instance when given the correct binding (`env.BROWSER`).

**The Reason You're Not Getting HTML:**

The analysis you posted describes creating a `test-browser.ts` file and *changing the `main` entry point in `wrangler.toml` to point to this test file*.

This means when you access `https://webagent.bakintola1.workers.dev/`, you are **running the code inside `test-browser.ts`**, not your original crawler code! The test code likely just launches the browser, confirms it works, and returns the success message, without actually trying to scrape anything.

**What to Do Now:**

1.  **Revert `wrangler.toml`:** Change the `main` field back to your original application entry point. Based on your file structure, this is likely:
    ```toml
    # wrangler.toml
    # ... other config ...
    main = "src/crawler/index.ts" # Change this back
    # ... rest of config ...
    ```

2.  **Focus on the `Crawler` Code:** The problem is almost certainly in how the `env.BROWSER` binding is being passed *from* your API handler (likely in `src/crawler/api.ts`) *to* your `Crawler` class (likely in `src/crawler/crawler.ts` or `src/crawler/utils/browser.ts`) and then *used* within that class to call `puppeteer.launch`.

3.  **Show the Relevant Code:** Please share the following code snippets:
    *   The function in `src/crawler/api.ts` that handles the incoming request (like `handleHtmlExtraction`). Specifically, show how it gets the `env` object and how it creates an instance of your `Crawler`.
    *   The constructor of your `Crawler` class (in `src/crawler/crawler.ts`). How does it receive and store the browser binding?
    *   The method inside your `Crawler` class (or `browser.ts`) where `puppeteer.launch()` is actually called. How does it access the stored browser binding?

**Example of Correct Passing:**

```typescript
// --- src/crawler/api.ts (Example API Handler) ---
import { Crawler } from "./crawler"; // Assuming Crawler is in crawler.ts

export async function handleHtmlExtraction(request: Request, env: { BROWSER: Fetcher }): Promise<Response> {
  // ... get crawlerOptions ...

  // CORRECT: Pass the specific binding env.BROWSER
  const crawler = new Crawler(env.BROWSER, crawlerOptions);

  // INCORRECT examples:
  // const crawler = new Crawler(env); // Don't pass the whole env object unless Crawler expects it
  // const crawler = new Crawler(); // Doesn't pass the binding at all

  const data = await crawler.extractHtml(/* ... */);
  // ...
}

// --- src/crawler/crawler.ts (Example Crawler Class) ---
import puppeteer from "@cloudflare/puppeteer";

export class Crawler {
  private browserBinding: Fetcher; // Store the binding
  private options: any;

  // CORRECT: Constructor accepts the Fetcher binding directly
  constructor(browserBinding: Fetcher, options: any) {
    this.browserBinding = browserBinding;
    this.options = options;
  }

  async someScrapingMethod(url: string) {
    let browser;
    try {
      // CORRECT: Use the stored binding
      browser = await puppeteer.launch(this.browserBinding);
      const page = await browser.newPage();
      await page.goto(url);
      // ... scrape ...
      return /* scraped data */;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in crawler:", error);
      throw error; // Re-throw or handle appropriately
    } finally {
      await browser?.close();
    }
  }
}
```

Once you revert `main` in `wrangler.toml` and we examine how `env.BROWSER` is passed to your `Crawler` class, we should be able to pinpoint the exact cause of the "The receiver is not an RPC object" error in your main application flow.
